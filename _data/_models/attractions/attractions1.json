And the place is frequented by all kinds of people. Great atmosphere, photos of famous visitors everywhere. The place has been there since 1888, before the Empire State Building. They accept cards and cash, but DO NOT lose the ticket they give you, or you'll have to pay $50. And the food is not expensive at all, my bf paid $20 for him, my sister, and I last night.
